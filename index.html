    <ul>
      <h3 id="headline">Let me count the ways that I love him.</h3>
      <li><strong>1</strong> - Sometimes, when I am very sad, he comes and sits on top of me. I cannot breathe and if I cannot breathe, I cannot cry.</li>
      <li><strong>2</strong> - He gives me a reason to get up everyday. He needs to eat. He needs to go outside and make a potty.</li>
      <li><strong>3</strong> - When he plays he throws his little paws in the air and down so fast. He looks so goofy; it makes me smile.</li>
      <li><strong>5</strong> - We both have nightmares and we are both there for each other when the other needs it.</li>
     
    </ul>
